Want to experience puzzles and more difficulty in your playthrough? Look no further, as Terrasweeper generates mines throughout your world and challenges you to figure out which tile is a mine with regular Minesweeper logic.

How to play:
Right click any tile with yout picaxe to flag it 
If you mine wrongly flagged tile - you explode! 
If you mine non-flagged mine - you explode!
Succesfull mined mine drops Mined Mine, that are good weapon + allows you to craft some things 
I wonder what happens if you shimmer them... 
Red mines means wrongly mined mine and blue flags means solved mine. 
They still counts as a mine for a numbers, so keep this in mind!

Game also functional in Multiplayer!

Features:
Right-click with your pickaxe on an empty (or numbered) tile to mine all surrounding tiles if the number of flagged tiles and revealed mines equals the number itself! (Don't worry - this is balanced by weakening your pickaxe power for tile breaking!)
Minesweeper Potion - allows you to see mines around you for 3 seconds!
Flag Bomb - flags all mines around!
Changing the amount of mines in config - technically this is cheating, but if you want, you can change the amount of mines in the config! It will change their amount in your world automatically!

More features coming in future updates - leave your suggestions in the comments!

Good luck!
